These benefits include readability, consistency, and ease of integration.  \n\nCode conforming to a standard format is easier to read, especially if someone other than the original developer is examining the code.  In addition, formatted code can be debugged and corrected faster than unformatted code.\n\nIntroducing coding standards can help increase the consistency, reliability, and security of the application by ensuring common programming structures and tasks are handled by similar methods, as well as, reducing the occurrence of common logic errors.\n\nCoding standards also allow developers to quickly adapt to code which has been developed by various members of a development team.  Coding standards are useful in the code review process as well as in situations where a team member leaves and duties must then be assigned to another team member.  Coding standards often cover the use of white space characters, variable naming conventions, function naming conventions, and comment styles.  \n",

        "description": "A code review is a systematic evaluation of computer source code conducted for the purposes of identifying and remediating security flaws.  Examples of security flaws include but are not limited to format string exploits, memory leaks, buffer overflows or race conditions.  The code review is usually conducted during the application development phase, this allows discovered security issues to be corrected prior to release.  A code review can also be performed after the development phase, however, in all instances identified errors must go back to development for correction so conducting the code review during development is the logical and preferred action.  Automated code review tools are to be used whenever reviewing application source code.   These tools are often incorporated into many Integrated Development Environments (IDE) so code reviews can be conducted during all stages of the development life cycle.  Periodically reviewing code during the development phase makes transition to a production environment easier as flaws are continually identified and addressed during the development phase rather than en masse at the end of the development effort.\n\nCode review processes and the tools used to conduct the code review analysis will vary depending upon application architecture and the development languages utilized.\n\nIn addition to automated testing, manual code reviews may also be used to validate or augment automated code review results.  Larger projects will have a large code base and will require the use of automated code review tools in order to achieve complete code review coverage.\n\nA manual code review may consist of a peer review wherein other programmers on the team manually examine source code and automated code review results for known flaws that introduce security bugs into the application.\n\nAs with any testing, there is no single best approach and the tests must be tailored to the application architecture.  Use of automated tools along with manual review of code and testing results is considered a best practice when conducting code reviews. This method is the most likely way to ensure the maximum number of errors are caught and addressed prior to implementing the application in a production environment.\n\nFor a list of tools that can be used for source code review, please reference http://samate.nist.gov/index.php/Source_Code_Security_Analyzers.html.\nPlease note that reference to these tools does not imply that they have been tested and approved for use by DISA.\n",

        "description": "Use of automated scanning tools accompanied with manual testing/validation which confirms or expands on the automated test results is an accepted best practice when performing application security testing.  Automated scanning tools expedite and help to standardize security testing, they can incorporate known attack methods and procedures, test for libraries and other software modules known to be vulnerable to attack and utilize a test method known as \"fuzz testing\".  Fuzz testing is a testing process where the application is provided invalid, unexpected, or random data. Poorly designed and coded applications will become unstable or crash. Properly designed and coded applications will reject improper and unexpected data input from application clients and remain stable.   \n\nMany vulnerability scanning tools provide automated fuzz testing capabilities for the testing of web applications.  All of these tools help to identify a wide range of application vulnerabilities including, but not limited to; buffer overflows, cross-site scripting flaws, denial of service format bugs and SQL injection, all of which can lead to a successful compromise of the system or result in a denial of service.  \n\nDue to changes in the production environment, it is a good practice to schedule periodic active testing of production web applications.  Ideally, this will occur prior to deployment and after updates or changes to the application production environment. \n\nIt is imperative that automated scanning tools are configured properly to ensure that all of the application components that can be tested are tested.  In the case of web applications, some of the application code base may be accessible on the web site and could potentially be corrected by a knowledgeable system administrator.  Active testing is different from code review testing in that active testing does not require access to the application source code base. A code review requires complete code base access and is normally performed by the development team.\n\nIf vulnerability testing is not conducted, there is the distinct potential that security vulnerabilities could be unknowingly introduced into the application environment.\n\nThe following website provides an overview of fuzz testing and examples:\n\nhttp://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fuzzing\n\nThe following website provides information on web application vulnerability scanner tools.

The validation process will vary based upon the operating system used as there are numerous clients available that will display a file's cryptographic hash for validation purposes.  \n\nLinux operating systems include the \"sha256sum\" utility. For Linux systems using sha256sum command syntax is:  sha256sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...\n\nWindows does not natively provide a SHA256 checksum validation tool; however, there are utilities available that provide this capability. \n\nA validation process involves obtaining the application files\u2019 cryptographic hash value from the programs author or other authoritative source such as the application's web site.  A utility like the \"sha256sum\" utility is then run using the downloaded application file name as the argument.  The output is the files' hash value.  The two hash values are compared and if they match, then file integrity is ensured.\n\nIf the application being reviewed is a COTS product and the vendor used a SHA1 or MD5 algorithm to generate a hash value, this is not a finding.\n\nIf the application being reviewed is a COTS product and the vendor did not provide a hash value for validating the package, this is not a finding.\n\nIf the integrity of the application files/code is not validated prior to deployment to DoD operational networks, this is a finding.\n",

Care must be taken to ensure that application code and binaries are validated for integrity prior to deployment into a production environment.   \n\nTo ensure file integrity, application files and/or application packages are cryptographically hashed using a strong hashing algorithm.  Comparing hashes after transferring the files makes it possible to detect changes in files that could indicate potential integrity issues with the application.\n\nCurrently, SHA256 is the DoD approved standard for cryptographic hash functions.   DoD application developers must use SHA256 when creating cryptographic hashes, however, some non-DoD vendors might still use MD5 or SHA1 when generating a checksum hash for their application packages.  It is important to use the same algorithms when validating the hash.  If a non DoD vendor uses SHA1 when hashing their files, you must use SHA1 to validate the hash.  Otherwise, the hashes will not match and a false positive indication of tampering will result.\n\nPrior to release of the application receiving an ATO/IATO for deployment into a DoD operational network, the application must be validated for integrity to ensure no tampering of source code or binaries has occurred.
